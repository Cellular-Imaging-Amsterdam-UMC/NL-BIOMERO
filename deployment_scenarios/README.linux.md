# NL‚ÄëBIOMERO (Ubuntu/Linux) üöÄ

This guide covers deploying NL‚ÄëBIOMERO on **Ubuntu/Linux**, as always tuned for FAIR imaging with BIOMERO, OMERO.forms, and other plugins.

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 18.04+ with Docker & Docker Compose  
- OpenSSH client/server  
- `chmod`, `iptables` or `ufw`  
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificates (if using HTTPS)  
- `.env` file pre-filled with your secure secrets (I'll get back to that later)

---

## üîß Key Differences from Windows Docker Desktop

### 1. PostgreSQL Image  
```yaml
image: postgres:16-alpine
```
Alpine edition works more smoothly on Debian/Ubuntu hosts.

### 2. Privileged Access Needed
Add to omero-server, worker, and web containers:

```yaml
privileged: true
# or
security_opt:
  - seccomp:unconfined
```

### 3. SSH Permissions in biomero-worker
On Linux, SSH folder is too restrictive. Before launching containers:

```bash
chmod -R 777 ~/.ssh
docker compose up -d --build
chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh
```
You could add this into a bash script so you don't forget. Or just keep the .ssh folder open (but then you can't use it manually from the host). Btw, you could move that folder to /opt/omero or something, it doesn't need to be your user's home folder .ssh.

### 4. Containerized Slurm Build
**Note**: this is only about the "fake" Slurm <a href="https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm</a>. If you connect to an actual HPC you won't have these issues of course. You will have other issues probably ;)

Slurm doesn't build cleanly on Ubuntu. Build on Windows or CI, push to Docker Hub, then use, e.g.:

```yaml
services:
  slurm-worker:
    image: cellularimagingcf/slurm-docker-cluster-base:latest
```
```yaml
services:
  slurmctld:
    image: cellularimagingcf/slurm-docker-cluster-slurmctld:latest
```
In short: use <a href="https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm/blob/master/docker-compose-from-dockerhub.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`docker-compose-from-dockerhub.yml`</a> for deployment for local Slurm.

### 5. Host Networking (host.docker.internal Replacement)
**Note**: this is only about the "fake" Slurm <a href="https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm</a>. If you connect to an actual HPC you won't have these issues of course. You will have other issues probably ;)

Ubuntu doesn't support `host.docker.internal`. Use Docker's gateway IP (e.g. `172.17.0.1`). Also:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
```
and forward that port for Slurm SSH. Then your `biomeroworker` can SSH into your `slurmctld` via the host.

### 6. Volume Permission Fixes
"Permission denied" is common for mounts on Linux. Fix interactively on the host side:

```bash
chmod -R ...
```

Paths needing attention:
- Shared data volumes (e.g. L-Drive in the `web` folder)
- `slurm-config.ini` (in the `web` folder)
- SSH dir for `10-mount-ssh.sh` (`biomeroworker` startup)

Sometimes you might have permission issues inside a container;

```bash
docker-compose exec <container> bash
chmod ...
```

But, that is gone if you restart, so consider setting permissions in Dockerfiles if stable. (e.g. by making a GitHub issue about it). I have updated a few docker images for this purpose recently.

### 7. Secrets & Metabase Setup
Populate `.env` with secure values:

```text
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
OMERO_ROOT_PASSWORD=...
FORMS_MASTER_PASSWORD=...
METABASE_USER=...
METABASE_PASSWORD=...
METABASE_SECRET_KEY=...
```

‚ö†Ô∏è `.env` is committed in the repo‚Äîoverride before first run. *And don't commit those changes ;)*

For Metabase:
1. Log in to `localhost:3000` with default credentials
2. Go to (admin) settings to reset your password and to the database embed settigns for a new secret key
3. Update `.env` and redeploy

### 8. HTTPS via Nginx Reverse Proxy
To get SSL / HTTPS, you need to add a reverse proxy server like NGINX to reroute your server's traffic and check against SSL certificates.

You could add this nginx service in Docker Compose:

```yaml
nginx:
  image: nginx:alpine
  networks:
    - omero
  ports:
    - "4080:4080"  # OMERO HTTP
    - "4443:4443"  # OMERO HTTPS
    - "3000:3000"  # Metabase HTTP
    - "3443:3443"  # Metabase HTTPS
  volumes:
    - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    - /etc/letsencrypt/:/etc/letsencrypt:ro
```

üîê Don't expose OMERO or Metabase ports directly‚Äîroute traffic through nginx.

This is an alternative to directly forwarding the 4080 and 3000 ports from the OMERO.web/Metabase services to your host system. Adapt the `nginx.conf` to fit your scenario (like the server url). *Hint: you can forward ports 80 and 443 to 4080 and 4443 on your host to catch all normal http(s) traffic to your server URL.*

### 9. Persistent Logs
You probably want persistent logfiles. 

Add volume mounts for logs to map them to your host system:

```yaml
services:
  omero-web:
    volumes:
      - ./logs/omero-web:/opt/omero/web/OMERO.web/var/log
```

This removes the need for `docker-compose exec ...` to read logs, and keeps historic logs around after you redeploy the container.

## ‚úÖ Quick Start (Ubuntu)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO.git /opt/omero/NL-BIOMERO

# Prepare .env with secure values
nano /opt/omero/.env

# Setup SSL
# Ensure you have SSL certs first at /etc/letsencrypt/
nano /opt/omero/nginx/nginx.conf

# Setup SSH
mkdir /opt/omero/.ssh
cp /opt/omero/ssh.config.ubuntu.example /opt/omero/.ssh/config
touch /opt/omero/.ssh/known_hosts
# Copy, or make, SSH keys to that same folder
# e.g. ssh-keygen -t rsa

# Setup some permissions
chmod -R 777 /opt/omero/.ssh
chmod -R 777 /opt/omero/NL-BIOMERO/web/L-Drive
chmod -R 777 /opt/omero/NL-BIOMERO/web/slurm-config.ini

docker-compose -f /opt/omero/docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml up -d --build
docker-compose -f /opt/omero/docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml logs -f

# Change metabase secrets at :3000 / :3443 and update .env
# restart 
docker-compose -f /opt/omero/docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml down
docker-compose -f /opt/omero/docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml up -d --build
```

üëâ Ensure your firewall allows ports: **4080**, **4443**, **3000**, **3443**, and **2222**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| "Permission denied" (SSH) | Use `chmod -R 777 ~/.ssh` before booting |
| Web login/password issues | Make sure `.env` is set, and handle Metabase first-login flow |
| Slurm SSH failure | Verify Docker gateway IP and open port 2222 |
| SSL certificate issues | Confirm cert paths and reload nginx |

---

## üß† Lessons Learned

- **Permissions make or break Linux deployments**‚Äîpre-fix if possible
- `host.docker.internal` is unavailable: use dynamic gateway IP
- **Slurm is brittle**‚Äîbetter to pre-build and host container images
- **Nginx proxy handles HTTPS**, hides internal ports
- **Probably mount logs**‚Äîno more chasing with `exec` & `tail`

---

## üìã TL;DR

- Use `postgres:16-alpine`
- Add `privileged`/`unconfined` seccomp
- `chmod 777` SSH and writable mounts
- Deploy Slurm via pre-built images
- Use Docker gateway IP and open 2222
- Manage secrets via `.env`, treat Metabase manually
- Layer nginx proxy & mount SSL directories
- Persist logs via volume mounts
