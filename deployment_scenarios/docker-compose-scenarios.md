# NL-BIOMERO Deployment Scenarios and Docker Compose Files

This document outlines the different deployment scenarios for NL-BIOMERO and maps them to corresponding docker-compose configurations.

> Note: The docker-compose files and flows described here are examples for inspiration. They are not official recommendations or complete fixes; review and adapt them for your environment before production use.

## Overview

NL-BIOMERO supports multiple deployment scenarios from development to production. This guide will help you choose the right configuration for your needs.

## Important Usage Note

> **Note:** All Docker Compose configurations in this project can be run from the root of the git repository by:
> 1. Specifying the compose file path with `-f`
> 2. Providing the appropriate environment file with `--env-file`
> 3. Using the `up -d` flags to start containers in detached mode
>
> **Example:**
> ```bash
> docker compose -f ./deployment_scenarios/docker-compose-importer-only.yml --env-file .env.shared up -d
> ```

The examples below assume you're in the `deployment_scenarios` directory, but you can run them from the project root with the above pattern. Just double check the relative paths if you run them from somewhere else, especially if they have to build the containers instead of pull them from DockerHub.

## Scenario 0: Development & Demo

### Scenario 0.1: Local Development Setup
**Purpose**: For developers working on NL-BIOMERO components

**Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose-dev.yml`

**Key Features**:
- Builds images from local source code
- Includes development-specific settings
- Keeps omeroweb running with `tail -f /dev/null` to allow direct development inside the container

**Usage**:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

### Scenario 0.2: Default (Local Build)
**Purpose**: Testing with locally built images

**Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose.yml`

**Key Features**:
- Builds all components from local source code
- Includes standard configuration
- Suitable for testing before releasing to production

**Usage**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Scenario 1: Fresh Deployment (no existing data)

### Scenario 1.1: Standard Production Deployment
**Purpose**: Production deployment with prebuilt images

**Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose-from-dockerhub.yml`

**Key Features**:
- Uses prebuilt images from Docker Hub
- Standard configuration with production defaults
- No existing OMERO data required

**Usage**:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-from-dockerhub.yml up -d
```

### Scenario 1.2: Production with SSL (Ubuntu)
**Purpose**: Secure production deployment with SSL

**Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml`

**Key Features**:
- Includes Nginx for SSL termination
- Configured for Ubuntu environments
- Provides secure HTTPS access to web interfaces

**Usage**:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml up -d
```

---

## Scenario 2: Fresh Deployment with Existing Data

### Scenario 2.1: Restore from OMERO Backup
**Purpose**: Deploy with existing OMERO/BIOMERO data

**Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose-with-restored-data.yml`

**Key Features**:
- Configured to use external volumes for restored data
- Compatible with backup/restore scripts
- Maintains data integrity from previous installations

**Usage**:
```bash
# 1. Restore data using backup_and_restore scripts
./backup_and_restore/restore/restore_db.sh
./backup_and_restore/restore/restore_server.sh
./backup_and_restore/restore/restore_metabase.sh

# 2. Deploy with restored data volumes
docker-compose -f docker-compose-with-restored-data.yml up -d
```

---

## Scenario 3: Hybrid Deployment with Existing OMERO Server

> **⚠️ Warning:** This scenario is not properly tested and requires advanced OMERO grid configuration. You will need to establish an OMERO.grid connection between your existing OMERO server and the NL-BIOMERO components, including ensuring port 4061 (and potentially others) of the host OMERO server is accessible. The docker-compose files provided are starting points and will likely require significant customization for your specific environment. Feel free to contact the development team (e.g. on <a href="https://image.sc" target="_blank">image.sc</a>) for any assistance with this deployment scenario.

### Scenario 3.1: BIOMERO Only (External OMERO)
**Purpose**: Connect to existing external OMERO server

**Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose-biomero-only.yml`

**Key Features**:
- Deploys only BIOMERO components
- Configured to connect to external OMERO server
- Minimal footprint when OMERO is already deployed

**Usage**:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file for external OMERO configuration
cp external-omero.env.example .env

# Edit .env to set external OMERO server details
nano .env

# Deploy BIOMERO components
docker-compose -f docker-compose-biomero-only.yml up -d
```

### Scenario 3.2: BIOMERO.importer Only (External OMERO)
**Purpose**: Deploy only BIOMERO.importer with existing OMERO

**Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose-importer-only.yml`

**Key Features**:
- Deploys only BIOMERO.importer component
- Configured to connect to external OMERO server
- Focused on automated data import functionality

**Usage**:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file for external OMERO configuration
cp external-omero.env.example .env

# Edit .env to set external OMERO server details
nano .env

# Deploy BIOMERO.importer components
docker-compose -f docker-compose-importer-only.yml up -d
```

---

## Additional Configurations

### Component Selection with Profiles
Some docker-compose files support selective component deployment using profiles:

```bash
# Deploy only with importer enabled
docker-compose --profile importer_enabled up -d

# Deploy without importer
docker-compose up -d
```

You can build that in to any of the compose files to have the option of deploying only a subset of containers, without having to maintain multiple docker-compose files. See [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/profiles/).

### Toggle UI Modules (OMERO.biomero plugin)
In the `.env` file you can hide specific UI modules without removing containers:

```bash
# BIOMERO.importer web UI
IMPORTER_ENABLED=TRUE  # set FALSE to hide importer UI

# BIOMERO.analyzer workflows UI
ANALYZER_ENABLED=TRUE  # set FALSE to hide BIOMERO UI
```

Setting either variable to `FALSE` removes only the corresponding frontend elements in OMERO.web; backend containers can still run if present.

### Environment Customization
All deployments should be customized by editing the `.env` file before deployment:

```bash
# Edit environment variables
nano .env

# Then deploy
docker-compose up -d
```

Note that all values in the original .env file are public open source knowledge, so don't deploy those values on your public facing instances. See the documentation on how to change passwords of the different services, like Metabase.

## Creating a Custom Deployment

1. Start with the docker-compose file closest to your needs
2. Customize volumes, ports, and environment variables
3. Use docker-compose override files for minor changes

Example override file (`docker-compose.override.yml`):
```yaml
services:
  omeroweb:
    ports:
      - "8080:4080"  # Use different port
  
  omeroserver:
    environment:
      CONFIG_omero_web_public_enabled: "true"  # Enable additional feature
```
