Architecture Overview
=====================

NL-BIOMERO consists of several interconnected components:

Container Architecture
----------------------

The platform uses Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple services:

* **omeroserver** - Core OMERO server with BIOMERO scripts
* **omeroweb** - Web interface with custom plugins
* **biomeroworker** - BIOMERO analysis processor
* **metabase** - Analytics and visualization dashboard
* **database** - PostgreSQL for OMERO data
* **database-biomero** - PostgreSQL for BIOMERO workflows
* **omeroadi** - Service for data import

Network Architecture
--------------------

Services communicate through Docker networks:

* Internal network for database connections
* Exposed ports for web access (4080, 3000)
* OMERO ports for client connections (4063, 4064)

Storage Architecture
--------------------

Persistent data is managed through mounted or Docker volumes:

* OMERO data volume for image metadata storage
* Database volumes for persistent data
* Configuration mounts for customization

Integration Points
------------------

* **Slurm Integration** - BIOMERO connects to HPC clusters
* **SSH Configuration** - Secure connections to compute resources  
* **Shared Storage** - Common data access across services
