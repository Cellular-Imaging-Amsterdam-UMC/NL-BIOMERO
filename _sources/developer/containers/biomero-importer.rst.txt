BIOMERO.importer Container
==========================

.. note::
   **ADI** is the deprecated name for this service. The new canonical name is **BIOMERO.importer**.

The BIOMERO.importer service handles automated data import workflows and order management.

Overview
--------

BIOMERO.importer provides:

* **Automated Import**: Hands-free data import from configured directories
* **Order Management**: Import job queuing and tracking
* **File Monitoring**: Automated detection of new data files
* **Integration**: Seamless connection with OMERO server and web interface

See the `BIOMERO.importer README <https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/BIOMERO.importer#readme>`_ for detailed setup, configuration, and usage.

Import order creation and management
------------------------------------

Orders are managed in PostgreSQL. Tables are created by BIOMERO.importer via SQLAlchemy at startup, using the database configured by ``INGEST_TRACKING_DB_URL`` (env var preferred) or in ``settings.yml`` (see below).

Ways to create orders:

- OMERO.biomero web plugin: Uses the ``biomero_importer`` Python library to insert into both the main imports table and the preprocessing table when needed.
- Direct SQL: Insert directly into the database (see the `BIOMERO.importer README <https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/BIOMERO.importer#readme>`_ for schema details).
- Programmatically: Use the ``biomero_importer`` Python library from any client.

Database access:

- See :doc:`database` for information on how to access the PostgreSQL database.
- You can also browse tables in Metabase. See :doc:`metabase`. Note: Metabase browsing is read-focused; creating new orders is typically done via OMERO.biomero or direct SQL.

File system monitoring and processing
-------------------------------------

- The shared file system is mounted into biomero-importer at ``/data``. The importer user must have read/write permissions.
- Orders can reference any files/folders under this mount. The OMERO.biomero app can restrict selectable folders per group in its UI; the database itself does not enforce these restrictions.
- When preprocessing is enabled, converted files are written back alongside originals under a ``.processed`` subfolder within the same directory.
- All imports are in-place. OMERO.server must mount the same storage at the same path for symlink-based imports to work.
- For large/long imports, enable preprocessing: after preprocessing BIOMERO.importer imports from local temporary storage on OMERO.server, then redirects symlinks to the network location afterward. This reduces network risk during in-place import.

Configuration
-------------

- ``settings.yml`` is read at startup. Prefer environment variables for secrets and URLs.
- Key options:

  - ``ingest_tracking_db`` (or ``INGEST_TRACKING_DB_URL`` via env)
  - ``log_level``, ``log_file_path``
  - ``max_workers``
  - OMERO CLI import tuning per worker: ``parallel_upload_per_worker``, ``parallel_filesets_per_worker``
  - OMERO CLI import skips: ``skip_all``, ``skip_checksum``, ``skip_minmax``, ``skip_thumbnails``, ``skip_upgrade``
- You can bind-mount a customized ``settings.yml`` into the container to override defaults.
- Some settings can be tuned for performance depending on your storage and data shape.

Integration with OMERO server
-----------------------------

- The biomero-importer container shares both ``/OMERO`` and ``/data`` with OMERO.server. This is required for preprocessing and in-place imports.
- BIOMERO.importer authenticates to OMERO as root initially, then switches context to the requesting user/group to perform the import as that user.

Custom import pipeline development
----------------------------------

- See the `BIOMERO.importer README <https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/BIOMERO.importer#readme>`_ for container interfaces and examples.
- Provide a standalone Docker/Podman-compatible container that follows the IO conventions (inputs/outputs and optional JSON metadata). BIOMERO.importer will run it via podman-in-docker/podman-in-podman.
- Windows note: preprocessing containers should run as root inside the container to avoid file permission issues on mounted volumes. On Linux, userns keep-id can help for non-root, but Windows Docker commonly needs root.
- Files without preprocessing are imported in-place using OMERO CLI/bioformats via ezomero/CLI integration.

Error handling and retry mechanisms
-----------------------------------

- Logs: application and import logs are written in the container (default: ``/auto-importer/logs``). Each import also has dedicated OMERO CLI logs.
- Failed imports: orders are marked as FAILED and are not retried automatically. You can set them back to PENDING to re-run.
  
Example to retry a specific order by UUID:

.. code-block:: sql

   UPDATE imports
   SET stage = 'Import Pending'
   WHERE uuid = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';

Testing
-------

Quick checks for a running deployment:

Run a small end-to-end test order:

.. code-block:: bash

   # BIOMERO.importer upload health check
   podman exec -it biomero-importer /bin/bash -c "python tests/t_main.py"

Test podman-in-podman:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Podman-in-podman test run
   podman exec -it biomero-importer /bin/bash -c "podman run docker.io/godlovedc/lolcow"

See the `BIOMERO.importer README <https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/BIOMERO.importer#readme>`_ for details on configuring ``settings.yml`` to point to your demo file and target destination.

Security and runtime requirements
---------------------------------

.. note::
   BIOMERO.importer runs podman-in-podman (or podman-in-docker). The container currently requires ``--privileged`` and access to ``/dev/fuse`` for running preprocessing containers as the importer user. Some reports suggest alternatives may be possible on specific platforms, but our attempts without privileged have not been reliable yet. A potential future improvement is to switch the podman engine that runs BIOMERO.importer to a different model so the inner podman can run without privileged.
